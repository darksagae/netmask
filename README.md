The `netmask` command is a Kali Linux tool used to calculate and display various network masks and IP address ranges. Here's how to use it and some examples:

**Basic Usage:**

1. Open a terminal in Kali Linux.
2. Type `netmask` followed by the IP address and netmask (in CIDR notation) you want to calculate. For example: `netmask 192.168.1.0/24`

**Options:**

* `-c`: Display the classful network mask (e.g., Class A, B, or C).
* `-n`: Display the network address and broadcast address.
* `-h`: Display the help menu.

**Examples:**

1. `netmask 192.168.1.0/24`
Output:
```
Network:   192.168.1.0/24
Netmask:  255.255.255.0
Wildcard: 0.0.0.255
 Network Address: 192.168.1.0
Broadcast Address: 192.168.1.255
HostMin: 192.168.1.1
HostMax: 192.168.1.254
```
In this example, `netmask` calculates the network mask, wildcard mask, network address, broadcast address, and host range for the given IP address and netmask.

2. `netmask -c 10.0.0.0/8`
Output:
```
Class A network: 10.0.0.0/8
Netmask: 255.0.0.0
```
In this example, `netmask` displays the classful network mask for the given IP address and netmask.

**Note:** The `netmask` command is useful for network administrators and penetration testers to quickly calculate network masks, IP address ranges, and other network-related information.

I hope this helps!

```netmask``` is not a standard tool pre-installed in Kali Linux, nor is it a common network reconnaissance tool. It's possible there's a misunderstanding, or you might be thinking of a different tool or a custom script. However, the functionality of determining network addresses and ranges is often achieved using other tools and commands available in Kali Linux.

If your goal is to determine the network address, broadcast address, or usable host range from a given IP address and netmask, you can achieve this using command-line utilities and scripting. Here's how you can accomplish similar tasks:

**1. Using `ipcalc`**

`ipcalc` is a tool that can perform IP address calculations. If it's not already installed, you can install it with:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ipcalc
```

To use `ipcalc` to display network information:

```bash
ipcalc 192.168.1.10/24
```

**Example Output:**

```
Address:   192.168.1.10        0xC0A8010A
Netmask:   255.255.255.0       0xFFFFFF00 = 24
Wildcard:  0.0.0.255           0x000000FF
=>
Network:   192.168.1.0         0xC0A80100
HostMin:   192.168.1.1         0xC0A80101
HostMax:   192.168.1.254       0xC0A801FE
Broadcast: 192.168.1.255       0xC0A801FF
```

This output provides the address, netmask, network address, minimum and maximum host addresses, and the broadcast address.

**2. Using `ip addr` and `awk`**

You can use `ip addr` to get the IP address and netmask, then use `awk` to parse the output. This method requires more manual parsing but can be useful in scripts.

```bash
ip addr show eth0 | grep "inet " | awk '{print $2}'
```

This command will output the IP address and CIDR notation (e.g., `192.168.1.10/24`). You would then need additional scripting to calculate the network address, broadcast address, etc., from this information.

**3. Scripting with Python**

You can use Python's `ipaddress` module to perform these calculations.

```python
import ipaddress

def calculate_network_info(ip_address):
    network = ipaddress.ip_network(ip_address, strict=False)
    print(f"Address: {network.network_address}")
    print(f"Netmask: {network.netmask}")
    print(f"Broadcast: {network.broadcast_address}")
    print(f"Number of hosts: {network.num_addresses-2}")

calculate_network_info('192.168.1.10/24')

```

**Example Output:**

```
Address: 192.168.1.0
Netmask: 255.255.255.0
Broadcast: 192.168.1.255
Number of hosts: 254
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Address:** The starting address of the network.
*   **Netmask:** The subnet mask that defines the network size.
*   **Broadcast:** The address used to send messages to all hosts on the network.
*   **Number of hosts:** The number of usable host addresses in the network (excluding network and broadcast addresses).

These methods provide ways to perform network calculations and retrieve network information using tools readily available in Kali Linux. If you have a specific tool named ```netmask``` in mind, it might be a custom or third-party tool, and you would need to provide more details about its origin and installation.

     ```
     netmask> 255.255.255.0
     Binary: 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
     ```
   - To convert a binary subnet mask to decimal:
     ```
     netmask> 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
     Decimal: 255.255.255.0
     ```

2. **Calculate Network and Broadcast Addresses**:
   - Given an IP address and subnet mask:
     ```
     netmask> 192.168.1.100 255.255.255.0
     Network address: 192.168.1.0
     Broadcast address: 192.168.1.255
     ```

3. **Get the Number of Hosts in a Subnet**:
   - To get the number of hosts in a subnet:
     ```
     netmask> 255.255.255.0
     Hosts/Subnet: 254
     ```

4. **Perform Subnet Calculations**:
   - To calculate the subnet information for a given network:
     ```
     netmask> 192.168.0.0/24
     Network: 192.168.0.0
     Netmask: 255.255.255.0
     Hosts/Subnet: 254
     Broadcast: 192.168.0.255
     ```

5. **Use Shorthand Notation**:
   - You can also use the shorthand notation for subnet masks, such as `/24` instead of `255.255.255.0`:
     ```
     netmask> 192.168.1.100/24
     Network: 192.168.1.0
     Netmask: 255.255.255.0
     Hosts/Subnet: 254
     Broadcast: 192.168.1.255
     ```

**Output Example**:
Here's an example of the output you might see when running `netmask` with the command `192.168.1.100 255.255.255.0`:

```
Network address: 192.168.1.0
Broadcast address: 192.168.1.255
Hosts/Subnet: 254
```

This output shows the network address (192.168.1.0), the broadcast address (192.168.1.255), and the number of available hosts in the subnet (254).
